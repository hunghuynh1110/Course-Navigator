Types of loading, the probabilistic basis for both self-weight and applied loading and the concept of design limit states will lead to calculation of loading for stability, strength and; serviceability limit states, based on Australian Standards. The concept of load paths and the requirement for stability, strength and stiffness for both braced and un-braced (sway) framed structures are introduced. This knowledge will be applied to the design of simple steel frames, to calculate member sizes or capacity in tension, compression, shear and bending and the connections required to create a practical structure, based on Australian Standards. This course will prepare students for subsequent courses in the structural design of statically indeterminate steel frames and structural design in other materials, structural systems or forms.",

        "description": "This course aims to develop a sound understanding of the environmental hydraulics, flood management and hydraulic design of civil engineering structures in a natural and built environment. Fundamental fluid mechanic principles are applied to professional water engineering problems. This course forms part of a major, which provides students with the skills to work in the water and environment sector of a Civil and Environmental Engineering profession. The course is a professional subject in which the students learn how to apply fundamental principles to practical situations. The design of a civil engineering structure in a floodplain is based on a system approach. The structure must be analysed as part of the surrounding catchment and the hydrology plays an important role. Structural and hydraulic constraints interact, and the design of a hydraulic structure is a complex exercise altogether. First, the system must be identified. What are the design objectives? what are the constraints? What is the range of options? What is the 'best choice'? Its detailed analysis must be conducted and the engineers should ask: Is this solution really satisfactory? During design stages, physical and computational models may be reliable 'tools' to compare the performances of various design options, including under flood scenarios. After completion of the course, each student will know how to apply the fundamental fluid mechanics principles to flood modelling in professional designs and they will be familiar with the multi-disciplinary aspects of an engineering project.",

It is not simply the short-term provision of infrastructure that is of prime importance but planning and designing infrastructure which takes full account of its own impact and its operational needs and use. Sustainable infrastructure design is not just about new infrastructure, it is about rehabilitation, reuse, or optimisation of existing infrastructure. Infrastructure must be sustainable if it is to benefit coming generations and make a positive contribution to the future. Students will learn how to use their knowledge of these processes by designing sustainably and quantitatively assess alternative design options. Design-based problems and case studies are used to build on theory and challenge students to use their skills in applied settings. Current sustainability certification schemes are used in developing a framework for sustainable design and assessment, and students are taught how to apply these critically. This consistent with the principles of urban sustainability and global sustainable development goals. (e.g., SDGs, EMF, ISCA - IS Ratings, Green Star, LEED, BREEAM).",

The key focus of the course will be on the practical aspects of applying the FE method appropriately to structural analysis and design. Students will be equipped with the fundamentals of finite element principles that will enable them to understand the behaviour of various finite elements, to be able to select appropriate elements to analyse structural problems. Series of examples on the use of FE in design of structures (using an open-source FE software) will be presented to demonstrate the use of FE in structural design. Students will also complete the design of a real-world structure, thereby obtaining hands-on experience on the use of FE method for analysis and design of structures.",

        "description": "Dams are important civil engineering structures that require geotechnical design, construction and maintenance to satisfy stability and sustainability. Worldwide dam construction activities have accelerated and more dams are in planning for the coming decades. Dams are an important measure to provide solutions to two big societal challenges worldwide, namely water supply and energy. Moreover, with the increasing likelihood of extreme weather events due to climate change, dams are playing a crucial role by acting as flood protection structures and providing drought storage. It is the responsibility of experienced geotechnical engineers to ensure that the design of the dam is able to withstand the hydraulic and mechanical loadings to be expected during the lifetime of the structure. This requires taking into account the conditions influenced by the geology of the site, the hydrology of the catchment, the meteorology of the region and all other influences affecting the safety of the dam to ensure the sustainable construction of the dam. The course introduces the fundamental concepts and methods for designing dams for various purposes ensuring the hydraulic and mechanical safety of the structure.",

For RC structures, students will be exposed to advanced analytical theory and design principles of non-conventional RC design such as non-flexural and torsional members, moment redistribution, confinement, design of high-strength concrete structural components. For concrete technology, the microstructures of hardened concrete/cementitious paste, their significance in performance of concrete structures and influencing factors will be explained. The course also covers practical aspects such as the use of fillers and chemical admixtures in high-performance concrete mix design, crack control and investigation, creep and shrinkage and various long-term durability issues. Real life case studies will be used to explain the problems that can occur, how these problems could be avoided and how these problems could be resolved.",

The course will introduce the grand unified theory of computation based on Turing machines, Lambda calculus and cellular automation. It will present the Church-Turing thesis to show that all these models are all equivalent. The theory of computation based on Turing machines will also include an introduction to finite state machines and their role in constructing regular languages. The course will also briefly introduce quantum computation and its applications. The necessary mathematical preliminaries in will be covered during the course.",

The development of recognition and automated algorithms that are able to process copious amounts data without (or with limited) human intervention is critical in replicating this ability in machines. This course will cover the fundamentals of creating computational algorithms and models that are able to recognise and/or analyse patterns within data of various forms. Topics and algorithms will include fractal geometry, classification methods such as random forests, recognition approaches using deep learning and models of the human vision system. Python, the open-source paradigm and state-of-the-art packages like Tensorflow, JAX and PyTorch will be used as a mechanism for students to study patterns in nature and solve problems from various real-worlds data sources, such images, social media and biomedical signals.",

The course covers basic digital logic design concepts including logic simplification, combinational and sequential building blocks, arithmetic circuits, finite state machines, and datapath/controller design for custom digital architectures. The course will provide implementation details from a reconfigurable logic perspective and discuss topics related to timing aspects. Students are introduced to hardware description language (HDL) based system design for field programmable gate array (FPGA) based platforms using VHDL as the standard language (other commonly used languages include Verilog, System-Verilog, and different variants of C). Following the conventional HDL based design flow using Xilinx/AMD EDA tools, students will be subsequently introduced to topics such as high-level synthesis, model-based system design and rapid prototyping for FPGAs with alternative tool flows such as Matlab HDL coder. As a compelling application for exploiting hardware parallelism offered by FPGAs, specific design techniques for real-time implementation of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms with hardwear acceleration on FPGAs will be introduced.",

In this course you will build upon the knowledge and skills you have developed so far to learn how to design complex systems. This will include how these systems communicate and coordinate their responsibilities. You will learn design techniques to manage the complexity of large systems. You will learn how to assess and manage software risks (e.g.security, scalability, availability, resilience, robustness). You will apply these techniques to build a system composed of heterogeneous computing devices (e.g. mobile devices, servers, cloud-hosted services). You will learn how to apply systems thinking to design large-scale cyber-physical systems.",

Issues in the mechanical design and dynamics of the vehicles are covered as a background needed for design of electronics and software for control, navigation and various applications. Design methods of avionics systems specific to small UAVs with civilian applications will be covered in a series of lectures and literature research assignments will complement the theoretical component of this course. The practical part will illustrate use of advanced methodologies (e.g. simulation with hardware in the loop) for developing avionics systems and the project will provide opportunity to check the developed design of avionics system on the flying vehicle.",

        "description": "Gathering, understanding, interpreting and making decisions based on collected data is an invaluable tool for science, business and governments. Concerns about privacy, consent, confidentiality, discrimination, ownership, commercialisation, intellectual property and the importance of fair benefit sharing are known. Being aware of conflicts of interest and the need to ensure equity, reciprocity and respect for cultural diversity are increasingly seen as important. What is less recognised is the nature of the roles of those who access and make decisions about collected linked personal information. The emerging global banked data that has become a key part of contemporary decision-making raises questions about the role of the data scientist. In this course students will critically analyse the ethical and legal foundations of data science governance that are relevant to the technical processes of data collection, storage, exchange and access. Issues covered will include the ethical dimensions of data management, legal and regulatory frameworks in Australia and in relevant jurisdictions, data policy, data privacy, data ownership, legal liabilities regarding analytical decisions, and discrimination. The course will equip students to identify the ethical and legislative requirements that underpin the technical processes of data science and to apply ethical and legal considerations to the core processes of data analytics. It will also introduce algorithms and technical approaches to minimise the risk of data identifiability and disclosure. A range of case studies will be used to explore these issues in applications of data science, including the use of government administrative data for informing social policy, to integrate ethical, legal and technical considerations.",

To deal with volume, velocity, and variety of data we need to rely on novel computational architectures that focus on scaling-out data processing as compared to the classic scale-up approach. Such systems allow to add computational resources to a distributed system depending on requirements and load which changes over time. In this course we will give students knowledge about modern scale-out system architectures to perform data analytics queries over very large structured/unstructured datasets as well as to run data mining algorithms at scale.",

You should aim for at least one entry per week throughout the semester, but multiple entries are encouraged. You must also ensure you have posted a project inspiration to your journal by the end of week 4. If students do not post for more than one week, a member of the teaching team will follow-up with the student during studio to discuss progress. If there are extenuating circumstances which prevent a student from updating their journal, they should inform the teaching team via the course mailbox. Note: Students will not be penalised for missing an entry in week 2 or 3 due to Cyclone Alfred interruptions The weekly deadline when checks will be made for regular posts is 3pm on the Wednesday (day before Studio). The final deadline for updates to the Design Journal is the end of Friday of week 13 (allowing for post-exhibit reflections)",

        "description": "This course introduces students to User Experience Design (UX), User Interface Design (UI), and Frontend Development (FED) with a focus on designing, developing, and deploying dynamic, human-centred websites and web apps. Today, the boundaries between UX, UI, and FED are increasingly blurred, and professionals in these roles are expected to understand and collaborate across these domains. This course prepares students for this interdisciplinary approach by combining foundational knowledge with practical applications.A key focus of this course is developing the problem-solving mindset required of web designers and developers. Rather than memorizing all web technologies, students will learn how to identify problems, seek out relevant information, interpret that information critically, and apply it effectively to design and development tasks. This mindset ensures that students can adapt to evolving technologies and frameworks, equipping them to work confidently in a constantly changing field.Students will learn to:Analyse client needs and user data to create effective, human-centred designs.Develop responsive (mobile first) websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, incorporating responsive and accessible design principles.Deploy and test websites on a web server, following modern workflows and best practices.Critically and effectively use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to support design ideation, content generation, and development while maintaining academic integrity and ethical standards.In addition to technical and design skills, students will explore the social, cultural, ethical, and cybersecurity issues that influence web design and development. These topics ensure that students can create websites that not only meet user goals but also align with broader societal values, accessibility standards, and best practices.The course emphasises activity-based learning, where students will work on guided tasks to develop their skills in identifying solutions",

You must also ensure you have posted a project inspiration to your journal by the end of week 4. If students do not post for more than one week, a member of the teaching team will follow-up with the student during studio to discuss progress. . If there are extenuating circumstances which prevent a student from updating their journal, they should inform the teaching team via the course mailbox. Note: Students will not be penalised for missing an entry in week 2 or 3 due to Cyclone Alfred interruptions The weekly deadline when checks will be made for regular posts is 3pm on the Wednesday (day before Studio). The final deadline for updates to the Design Journal is the end of Friday of week 13 (allowing for post-exhibit reflections)",

Stability or security of the power system is the most important issue in power system operations and management either in a regulated or deregulated environment. System stability analysis is one of the essential skills for an electrical engineer working in the power industry. Following the deregulation over the past 2 decades, many power systems have been pushed toward their stability limits in order to maximise profit in energy trading. This course will cover the essential techniques in electricity market as well as power system stability analysis. Students will learn electricity market management, structure, operations, power system modelling, system dynamics, stability and security assessment, and new challenges in power system stability in an electricity market.",

        "description": "The growth of various social media platforms over the last decade has revolutionized the way individuals interact and industries conduct business. Individuals produce data at an unprecedented rate by interacting, sharing, and consuming content through social media. Understanding and processing this new type of data to glean actionable patterns presents challenges and opportunities for interdisciplinary research, novel algorithms, and tool development. This course integrates social media, network analysis and data mining to provide a convenient and coherent platform for students to understand the basics and potentials of social media analytics. It introduces basic concepts in social media analytics, metrics to characterize networks, models to explain the generation of networks, and methods to analyse networks. The students learn to use software tools to visualize and analyse real-world social network data. The course also introduces a wide variety of advanced topics in social media analytics such as information diffusion, community detection, behaviour analytics, social recommendations and privacy preserving in social media. If you want to share a piece of information or a site on social media, you would like to grab precious attention from other equally eager users of social media; if you are curious to know what is hidden or who is influential in the complex world of social media, you might wonder how one can find this information in big and messy social media; if you hope to serve your customers better in social media, you certainly want to employ effective means to understand them better. These are just some scenarios in which this course can help.",

It builds an important foundation of knowledge in programming, numerical algorithms, and simulation techniques that is essential for modern day engineers. The course starts with numerical approaches for interpolation, differentiation and quadrature before introducing direct and iterative approaches to solve linear systems. Solution techniques for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and non-linear equations are formulated and techniques for data fitting and optimisation (inc. least-squares approaches) are developed and applied to engineering problems. The final module of the course formulates computational techniques to solve partial differential equations (parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic) with numerous applications involving heat transfer, convection-diffusion, and wave propagation. Completion of this course will provide students with the necessary skills to develop computational approaches to address a wide range of engineering problems.",

The course builds on the engineering problem solving activities of ENGG1200 and continues to explore the roles of computational modelling in design and materials behaviour in manufacturing. Students will learn that the design process involves the creation and prescription of the shape and characteristics of a product or machine within manufacturing and material performance constraints. Common and emerging manufacturing processes will be introduced. Professional engineers working in both engineering design and manufacturing will deliver guest lectures into the course in order to locate key concepts within real world contexts. Students will engage in a number of Computer Aided Design and Manufacturing exercises including CNC machining of components. Students will also be introduced to the role of process simulation and modelling in manufacturing. The primary technical learning outcomes will be addressed through a combination of learning strategies including online resources, traditional lectures, and active learning CAD exercises.",

Implemented Vercel Web Analytics integration as requested.

## Summary
Added Vercel Web Analytics to the Course Navigator React/Vite project to enable tracking of visitor interactions and page views on the Vercel platform.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
1. **client/package.json**
   - Added `@vercel/analytics` (v1.6.1) as a new dependency

2. **client/src/main.tsx**
   - Imported `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
   - Added `<Analytics />` component within the React render tree (inside SnackbarProvider, after RouterProvider)

## Implementation Details

### Framework: Vite + React
- Used the React-specific version of Vercel Analytics (`@vercel/analytics/react`)
- This provides seamless integration with React and automatic route tracking support

### Integration Approach
- Added the Analytics component as a child of the SnackbarProvider in the main.tsx entry point
- This ensures the analytics tracking script is loaded and initialized on every page render
- The placement inside the provider hierarchy ensures proper initialization context

## Deployment & Activation Steps (Next Steps for User)

To fully activate Web Analytics, the user should:
1. Enable Web Analytics in their Vercel dashboard (Project > Analytics > Enable)
2. Deploy the application to Vercel using: `vercel deploy` or by connecting their Git repository
3. After deployment, the analytics script will be active at `/_vercel/insights/script.js`
4. Visit the Analytics tab in the dashboard to view visitor data

## Verification
- ✓ Build successful (no errors, runs with `pnpm run build`)
- ✓ No linting errors in modified file (src/main.tsx)
- ✓ Dependencies correctly added to package.json
- ✓ pnpm-lock.yaml updated with new dependencies

## Notes
- Pre-existing linting errors in the codebase are unrelated to these changes
- When deployed to Vercel, the app will automatically track page views and custom events
- No route support limitations for this React implementation when using TanStack Router
- The Analytics component renders as a no-op in development mode and only activates when deployed to Vercel
